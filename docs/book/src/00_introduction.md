## What is Cluster API Provider RKE2

The [Cluster API](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/) brings declarative, Kubernetes-style APIs to cluster creation, configuration and management.

Cluster API Provider RKE2 (CAPRKE2) is a combination of 2 provider types, a __Cluster API Control Plane Provider__ for provisioning Kubernetes control plane nodes and a __Cluster API Bootstrap Provider__ for bootstrapping Kubernetes on a machine where [RKE2](https://docs.rke2.io/) is used as the Kubernetes distro.
