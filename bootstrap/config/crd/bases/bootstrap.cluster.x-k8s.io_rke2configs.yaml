                          For example, if the object reference is to a container within
                          a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                          (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                          the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]"
                          (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen
                          only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part
                          of an object. TODO: this design is not final and this field
